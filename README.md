# 2DPatrollingEnemy
2DPatrollingEnemy Is a simple 2D Patrolling Enemy Script Written for Unity 3D

This project uses Standard 2D Assets that are built into Unity 3D. It utilizes the Platform, Pink Crate and RobotBoy. The PatrollingEnemy and PatrollingEnemyEditor are the assets that have been added to allow the enemy to patrol between two points. It also detects collisions between the enemy and anything other than the ground to change direction as well. This way if the enemies patrol causes them to walk into other world objects they will still turn around and head back in the other direction.
